A recursive game for one player by Jason Rohrer

This game has music.  Please use speakers or headphones.



== Controls ==

Use ESC or Ctrl-Q to exit the game.

Keyboard and mouse controls for the game are quite simple, and brief
instructions are included in the game.  To view the instructions again
at any time, hit the "T" key.


If W,A,S,D keys are not comfortable for movement control on your keyboard,
edit "settings/upDownLeftRightKeys.ini" with a text editor to specify your
own set of four keys.  Note that arrow keys and I,J,K,L are already 
built-in as alternatives for movement.




== Screen Size ==

If the game doesn't look good at the default 640x480 full-screen on your 
monitor, you can edit the screen dimensions in the "settings" folder.  You
can also toggle full-screen mode.  Once the game has been started in 
full-screen mode, you can switch to windowed mode by pressing Alt-Enter.

If the game seems sluggish at the default 60 frames-per-second, 
particularly when entering things (which is the most CPU-intensive part of 
the game), try switching to 30 FPS by putting a 1 in 
"settings/halfFrameRate.ini".

If it still seems sluggish at 30 FPS, switch to 15 FPS by putting a 2 in 
that settings file.  If it still seems sluggish, try 7.5 FPS by putting a 3 
in that settings file, and so on.
