The game was developed on a 900MHz laptop where it runs at 30 frames per second and is perfectly playable.  On a 1.5 GHz Mac Mini, it runs at a smooth 60 frames per second.  In other words, it will most likely run on your computer.<br>
<br>
The only required library is OpenGL, which ships standard on MacOS and Windows and is readily available on GNU/Linux as well.<br>
<br>
Other stuff you will need:
<ul>
<li>keyboard</li>
<li>mouse</li>
<li>speakers or headphones</li>
</ul>
The gameplay involves mouse aiming, and while it's playable on a laptop trackpad, it's much better with a real mouse.
