In our favored version, His Holiness the Dali Lama and Stephen Hawking are seated next to each other at the Stockholm banquet after receiving their Nobel Prizes for Peace and Physics, respectively.  Between courses two and three, the discussion naturally turns to cosmology.  Before Hawking is even two sentences into his creation theory, the Dali Lama interrupts him.  "Mr. Hawking, I already read your book.  Many mistakes."  Shocked, Hawking presses for an example.  The Lama asserts that the universe is not "just floating there," but is instead supported on the back of a great tiger.  Smiling, Hawking asks what supports the tiger.  The Lama asserts that it stands upon an elephant.  Continuing to press, Hawking asks what supports the elephant.  "A giant turtle," comes the Lama's confident reply.  When asked, finally, what supports the turtle, His Holiness is briefly taken aback, but quickly replies, "Ah, after that it is turtles all the way down."
