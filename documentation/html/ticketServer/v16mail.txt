Version 16 of the game has just been posted.  It includes a subtle overhaul of how the world structure is generated and a new flag system for keeping track exploration on a global server.  Chart out this infinite space along with everyone else in the world---and leave your mark for others to see.  The frustration of the knock-down mechanic has also been dealt with.  A full change log has been posted below.

Version 16   2011-March-22

--Fixed to release mouse when Alt-Tabbing on GNU/Linux (thanks Matt).

--Changed so that all players in the world are climbing through exactly the 
  same deterministic (yet still procedurally generated and infinite) level 
  structure, making progress comparable.  Your level 53 is my level 53.

--Changed to eliminate the risk of recursive-knock-downs by placing rise marker
  near player starting position after knock-down.  Exploring knock-down level 
  to find power-ups is optional, but tempting (thanks Gregory Weir and Frank 
  Lantz).

--Improved accuracy of shadow drawing for objects. 

--Added player Flags and Anthems with a global server to track them.

--Movement keys are now released properly if they were held down when pause 
  invoked.
