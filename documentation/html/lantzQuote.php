This game is totally awesome. It really opens up at the
higher levels into something amazing. There's so much subtle depth here. I
still don't know exactly how all the systems relate to each other, but
that's ok, in fact, it's part of the fun, because unlike Between, where it
felt like trying to figure out the obscure systems was the only gameplay,
here I'm so enthralled by the moment to moment gameplay that I'm drawn into
the obscure systems, sort of on a just-in-time, or on-needed basis, and this
gradual learning is sweet. This is how the trick is meant to work, you earn
my trust and then I follow you down into the darkness.<br>
<br>

I mean, I still have just the vaguest feeling of "where I am" in your crazy
system of insides and outsides, but it doesn't matter, and eventually I
will. Meanwhile I am loving the full-on, eggs-out commitment to
COMBINATORICS in this game. The level geometry, critter behavior, and bullet
attributes work together in so many different ways to create so many
genuinely interesting situations.

I was worried at first, because the early levels are a little awkward and
stiff feeling, but once you get up there it really starts to sing.
