Product description:

Inside a Star-filled Sky is an infinite, recursive, tactical shooter by award-winning designer Jason Rohrer (Passage, Between).  What if you could enter an object in a level and find a level inside of it?  What if you could enter an object in /that/ level and find another level inside of that?  What if you could change an enemy or a power-up from the inside?  What if you could enter and change yourself?  What if these levels inside levels inside levels went all the way down---and all the way up?  Inside a Star-filled Sky is a hard, tactical shmup built around this core concept.


Key features:

--Unique recursive gameplay

--Enter things---enemies, power-ups, and even yourself---to alter them for your tactical advantage

--Procedurally generated levels, along with massive bullet combo system, offer limitless tactical variety
