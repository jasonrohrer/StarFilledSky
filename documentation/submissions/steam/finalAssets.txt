"A beautiful, violent crumb from infinity's table" --IGN 9/10

"Eloquently translates the incomprehensible concept of infinity into game form... Alternately maddening and sublime" --GamePro 4/5

Product description:

Inside a Star-filled Sky is an infinite, recursive, tactical shooter by award-winning designer Jason Rohrer (Passage, Between).  What if you could enter an object in a level and find a level inside of it?  What if you could enter an object in /that/ level and find another level inside of that?  

What if you could change an enemy or a power-up from the inside?  What if you could enter and change yourself?  What if these levels inside levels inside levels went all the way down---and all the way up?  

Inside a Star-filled Sky is a hard, procedurally-generated shmup built around this core concept.
