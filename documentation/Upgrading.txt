== Upgrading Instructions ==

To carry on where you left off from a previous version of Inside a Star-
filled Sky, simply copy all of the files from of your old "settings" 
folder into your new "settings" folder.  When asked whether to replace 
files, say "Yes" to all.

Note that you SHOULD NOT just delete the new "settings" folder and replace
it with your old folder, because later versions of the game have new 
settings that your old folder will not contain.  You need to copy your old
settings across, but keep the new settings files that you didn't have 
before.



== Note about Version 16 ==

Version 16 involves the big---yet subtle---change to a common world.  You
are no longer exploring your own personal level tree, but instead THE 
level tree that everyone else in the world is exploring.

You are also able to plant flags in the levels to mark your progress and 
discoveries.  Other players can see your flags via a global server. 

You can carry on with your v15 bookmark and simply jump to that spot in 
the new level tree.  However, you won't get a chance to plant flags on the
lower levels if you do that.  It's up to you.  If you want to start v16 
fresh from level 1, which will let you plant flags on the lower levels, 
simply delete your "settings/bookmark.ini" file.
