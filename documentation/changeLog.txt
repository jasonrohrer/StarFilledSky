Version 15

--Default player powers in tutorial stages now include extended range (thanks 
  Frank Lantz).

--Powers are now never decayed below level 1 on pass-up to higher self.

--Difficulty warning when entering a power-up is more clear (thanks Darius).

--Added a tutorial message about score and how to increase it.


--Fixed date stamping of graphics files in Source bundle (so that 'convert' is 
  not require to build) (thanks Malte Wessel).





Version 14    2011-February-22

--Fixed crash caused by language files that use extended ASCII characters 
  (thanks Malte Perenz).

--Changed to % instead of @ to quit from pause screen, because @ is 
  inaccessible on some non-US keyboards.

--Fixed so that % key to toggle playback display works even if speed control 
  keys are disabled.

--Fixed so that enter key is enabled on game quit/restart that happens in the 
  middle of the tutorial after enter has been explained (thanks Ian Bogost).

--Fixed so that game always fills screen vertically as much as it can, 
  preserving whole-multiple game pixels, regardless of aspect ratio.  Before, 
  it wasn't working properly in 16:9.

--Moved token level numbers up one pixel to make them easier to read, and 
  redesigned some of the token icons to make this shift possible (thanks 
  Daniel Benmergui).

--Added tool-tips marking the sub-level difficulty inside a token (thanks 
  Jonathan Blow).

--Token tool tips are now always shown instantly on mouse over (not just 3 
  times each).

--New, less severe formula for computing difficulty of levels inside tokens.

--Playback automatically reverts to windowed mode if the specified resolution 
  is not available.

--Alt-Tab now minimizes out of windowed mode as well as fullscreen mode.

--Made connection between token icons and sub-level layouts more extreme 
  (thanks Ian Bogost).

--Fixed a bunch of code warnings and a few bugs using cppcheck.

--Speed control keys are now off by default (can be turned on in settings).

--Fixed inside-enemy power-ups at level 0 so they are not capped at 1.




Version 12   2011-February-17

--Enemy base bullet speed now gradually increases, between levels 20 and 80, 
  up to being equal to player's bullet speed (before, enemy bullet speed was 
  always half player bullet speed).

--Fixed to eliminate easy 1-descent token doubling by reducing base level of 
  tokens that are on the floor inside a token.

--Changed base level of sub-tokens inside enemy tokens to mirror the new 
  player token distribution system (it really didn't make sense before).

--Increased difficulty modifier inside sub-token recursions.

--Capped heart bonus on knock-down to 8, to prevent gigantic heart bonuses
  that make you effectively invincible on higher levels.

--Fixed level difficulty modifier number overflower issues (thanks Jimmy 
  Andrews).

--Fixed power-set sum overflow issues (thanks Jimmy Andrews).

--Fixed power-up level numbers so that they don't overflow.  Added a bar-graph 
  style powers-of-ten display, along with three most significant digits.

--Fixed bug in health bar length when heart picked up right before rising.

--Fixed bug in token update when a sub-token picked up right before rising 
  (thanks Alexey Zubkov).

--Fixed glitch in the way explode and cornering were being combined.

--Tutorial now mentions IJKL movement alternative for lefties.




Version 11   2011-February-16

--Powers are sorted with strongest to the right whenever they are passed 
  upwards to encourage additional pick-ups (which will replace weakest powers 
  on left).

--Fixed delay and excess cpu/memory usage when entering high-level power-up 
  tokens (thanks Jimmy Andrews).

--Changed to only decay the weakest two powers in the set (encourages picking 
  up new powers to protect a big power that you have built up).

--Changed to only replace weakest power (or any empty slots) with hearts on 
  knock-down, to make knock-down even less brutal and frustrating.  Also sort 
  powers strongest-right on knock-down to encourage pickups before rising.

--Knock-down hearts that are added depend on difficulty of level you are being 
  knocked down into (more help when knocked down into a harder level).

--Fixed drawing glitch in power-set majority shading when a new token is pushed
  in.

--Fixed potential level-0 difficulty-free power-up-building exploit.

--Changed so that hearts are knocked off higher self when hit to thwart the 
  heart rush exploit.

--Changed to never decay hearts.

--Next-higher-self's hearts are always trimmed to match lower self's hearts to
  thwart heart-bootstrapping exploit.

--Changed behavior of Burst power so that it does not act effectively as a 
  range boost, and increased its basic explosion pattern on L1 to compensate.

  range to deal with the overpowered beekeeper combo (thanks Jimmy Andrews).

--Changed to decay high-level powers more dramatically than weaker powers.

  to level 1.

--Added a proper end message to tutorial.

--Switched to '@' to quit, because F4 is not available on some macs.

--Fixed bug in token pass-up when grabbing tokens right before rising.

--Fixed so that health bar for self in higher level on knock-down doesn't 
  instantly appear to refill itself.

--Added secure level-stack saving on exit to thwart reload-grind strategy.

--Fixed fade bug when hearts knocked off of lower level during zoom-out.

--Changed the way that heart tokens work (drop-off when player/enemy hit).

--Fixed a potentially fatal bug in the way enemies track the bullet they are 
  dodging.

--After rising back from a knock-down, level is completely reset (to thwart 
  skill-free grinding play).

--Changed to soften knock-down by leaving players with SOME of their powers. 

--Changed the conditions under which powers are passed upward (after knock down
  recovery and fresh-rise only).

--Eyes closed on all selves above you in infinite rise trunk to make new 
  power-pass-up thematically consistent (pass-up only to sleepers).

--Removed brief period of player immortality after rise-out. 

--Added gradual decay of passed-up powers to prevent same favorite set from 
  being used forever.

--Changed [X] and [Y] in tutorial to [That] and [This] to avoid keyboard 
  confusion.

--Hash checking of starting state parameters in recorded game files.




Version 8   2011-February-4

--Fixed aspect ratio bug that could cause resolution SMALLER than 640x480 to
  be picked.

--Added an always-safe, enemy-free buffer at level 0 (regardless of difficulty 
  modifier) to ensure that player does not get knocked down into the inverted 
  negative levels by accident.

--Changed to give player a partial difficulty break on knock-down when a 
  difficulty modifier is in effect (so that getting knocked down inside a hard 
  power-up sub-level isn't fatal).

--Saved level bookmark never saves for negative levels, so player cannot be 
  trapped in the inverted negative difficulty progression after quitting.

--Switch to SPACE as shooting alternative for track-pad users, and SHIFT to 
  enter things.

--Disabled entering immediately after entering something, to avoid double-enter
  confusion.

--Improved bounce as a stand-alone power-up by renewing bullet distance limit

--Changed first three power-up tutorial levels to include heart tokens.

--Powers are now carried with you as you rise up (except when rising out of 
  a knock-down).

--Number of powers on floor reduced from constant 10 to a geometric random
  variable (10 powers on one floor is now very rare).

--Floor power token levels now placed on a probability distribution (good
  tokens are rare, but possible).

--Made heat seek more noticeable at low levels, and much stronger at high 
  levels.

--Made bullet speed faster at lower levels so it's easier to notice.

  always at max for that level, to encourage more token recursion.

--Added level number coloring as extra reminder of what you are inside.

--Added a settings file for adjusting mouse speed.

--Added a half-second of immortality after rise-out.

--Fixed crash on exit during descent.

--Changed rise icon on info panel to be color-matching.
