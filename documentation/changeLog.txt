Version 5

--Fixed tutorial crash (thanks Stephen Lavelle).

--Added support for non-4:3 monitors (without black bars on sides).




Version 4   2011-January-23

--Fixed vertical screen position after zoom.

--Fixed health bar mismatch if power-up picked up right before rise.

--Fixed bug that caused tutorial power-ups to be present in lower levels upon
  restart even when tutorial has already been completed.

--Removed accuracy power-up to improve feel of basic shooting, and also because
  its effect was hard to notice, making it confusing.

--Made rapid fire more rapid at lower levels so it's easier to notice.

--Made heat seek more noticeable at low levels, and much stronger at high 
  levels.

--Made bullet speed faster at lower levels so it's easier to notice.

--Changed default set to [speed,heart,heart] to make shooting feel better
  at start of game.  Knock-down still results in [empty,heart,heart].

--Fixed timing of brief player immortality on rise-out.

--Fixed heat seek targeting to prevent it from jumping oddly between targets.

--Added a blended overlay to soften background tile colors.

--Shrank level maximum dimensions to 96x96 instead of 128x128.  Less wandering.

--Added glowing shimmer over player, enemies, and power tokens, with trails 
  for motion.

--Added drop shadows along wall edges.

--Added drop shadows under player, enemies, bullets, tokens, and crosshair.

--Changed so that current powers are carried down when intentionally entering
  something (though not when unintentionally knocked-down).

--Changed so that current powers revert to default when you are knocked down,
  forcing you to gather new powers before rising back out (no more rushing
  through after being knocked down).

--When inside a power token, in case of tie, right-most sub-power dominates.

--Added dimming of sub-powers inside a power token to make majority formula
  easier to understand.

--Made special enemy behaviors more likely at lower levels.

--Fixed issues with uneven weighting of enemy sub-powers.

--Enemy behavior tokens now each imply two extra hearts, to make up for the
  fact that they are taking up a slot.

--Floor tokens inside player now always level 1 (minimum), inside enemy now 
  always at max for that level, to encourage more token recursion.

--Added level number coloring as extra reminder of what you are inside.

--No more power-up tokens right where player starts (avoid confusion when
  zooming in and instantly picking up a power).

--Enemies now aim ahead of moving player (perfect aim).

--Added discrete segments to enemy health bars.

--Made enemy health bar fade-out framerate independent.

--Made enemy health bar outline more faint.

--Added musical sonar-type drum track to make finding rise marker easier.

--Added pause screen where player can type a message.

--Changed to fade out music during pause to avoid abrupt drop-out on quit.

--Improved tutorial that explains EVERYTHING.

--Enter verb is disabled in tutorial mode until it is explained (avoid 
  confusion).



Version 3   2011-January-6

--Fixed crash when rising out right onto a rise marker that will cause and
  immediate, subsequent rise (thanks Stephen Lavelle).

--Removed empty power-up tokens completely from all floors to reduce
  confusion about their function and increase tactical richness when trying
  to de-power an enemy.

--Fixed to ignore hidden files in playbackGame directory (a problem on Mac OS
  where .DS_STORE files are created automatically by the OS).

--Fixed memory leak upon quit during rise-out.

--Improved intro levels to introduce a few power-ups, and combinations
  of power-ups, one step at a time.

--Changed so that default player power set is always empty (with two hearts), 
  increasing the tactical challenge and also increasing the implicit penalty 
  for getting knocked down to a lower level.

--Shortened bullet fade-out at end of range to make bullet range easier
  to discern.

--Player base health is now 1, but combined with two default heart tokens,
  effective health is still 3 if the player picks up no tokens.

--Easier to read, segmented player health bar.

--Power ups now can change type based on the majority type of their sub-powers.

--Steepened power-up curves to make game more difficult faster (level 30 is
  now roughly as difficult as the old level 90).

--Fixed so that mouse speed is independent of screen resolution.

--Added a settings file for adjusting mouse speed.

--Added a half-second of immortality after rise-out.

--Fixed crash on exit during descent.

--Changed rise icon on info panel to be color-matching.

--Fixed to ensure good random mixing between rises and falls, even in 
  unpopulated levels.

--Recorded games now track tutorial status.

--Added saving of level number on quit.  Can resume at that level next game.

--Press P to pause game.

--Reduced power-up levels on player sub-floors and increased power-up levels
  on enemy sub-floors, encouraging more sub-recursion to power-up self
  and power-down enemies.

--Made bounce power-up unlimited (not on curve, level 20 now means 20 bounces).

--Added power inversion in negative levels.
